                <p> I should have been born in the 80's. The aesthetic is something I try to replicate in my work. It is beautiful and inspiring. The music, the vibe, the clothes... It fits me</p>
                <p> Along with the 80's, I enjoy a good vacation and I am sucker for the big city. It is a dream of mine to live in a busy metropolitan area and leave behind the slow pace of Provo.</p>
                <p> Most importantly I love my Wife. We have been married for almost a year and what an adventure it has been.</p>
